## A modern journal paradigm for molecular simulation: Open access, nonprofit, low cost, and updateable

The Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science (LiveCoMS) is a peer-reviewed, ultra-low-cost, open-access journal that invites your submissions.
LiveCoMS seeks to bring publication of educational, review, and best practices materials into the modern age, allowing authors to publish their work but then continue its development.
LiveCoMS also attempts to better align academic incentives with the realities of computational work that require development of community resources.
We provide a venue where authors can formally publish living documents including tutorials and "lessons learned" articles that are updated on an ongoing basis, but which still have clear authorship.
Our ["Why LiveCoMS"](http://www.livecomsjournal.org/article/2031-why-we-need-the-living-journal-of-computational-molecular-science) perspective explains why this approach is needed and how it can help our field.

We are delighted to announce that LiveCoMS opens for submission this December 1, 2017, accepting submissions in the areas of Best Practices Guides, Perpetual Reviews, Lessons Learned, and Comparisons of Molecular Simulation Packages.
We encourage interested authors to contact us immediately via [e-mail info?] with a presubmission letter, as per our [author instructions](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/policies/).

LiveCoMS is a peer-reviewed, open access journal with an article submission price of just $100 covering the full costs of peer review and publication.
Published by the University of Colorado Boulder, LiveCoMS is managed by David Mobley, Michael Shirts, and Daniel Zuckerman, with category lead editors Rommie Amaro, David Mobley, Jean-Philip Piquemal, Michael Shirts, and Daniel Zuckerman.
We have a world-class [editorial board](http://www.livecomsjournal.org/editorial-board) who look forward to receiving your submissions, and to interacting with you as we advance the field of molecular simulations.
