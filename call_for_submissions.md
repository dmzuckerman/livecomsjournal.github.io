The Living Journal of Computational Molecular Science (LiveCoMS) invites your submissions to this innovative new publishing venue.
LiveCoMS seeks to bring publication of educational, review, and best practices materials into the Internet age, allowing authors to publish their work but then continue its development.
We provide a venue where authors can provide living documents that are updated on an ongoing basis as websites or Wikipedia articles could be, but which still have clear authorship and provide a mechanism for authors to get publication credit for their work.
Our ["Why LiveCoMS"](http://www.livecomsjournal.org/article/2031-why-we-need-the-living-journal-of-computational-molecular-science) perspective gives further detail on why this approach is needed and how it can help our field.

We are delighted to announce that LiveCoMS opens for submission this December 1, 2017, accepting submissions in the areas of Best Practices Guides, Perpetual Reviews, and Comparisons of Molecular Simulation Packages.
We encourage interested authors to contact us immediate via [e-mail info?] with a presubmission letter, as per our [author instructions](https://livecomsjournal.github.io/authors/policies/).

LiveCoMS is a peer-reviewed, open access journal run by the University of Colorado Boulder.
Article submission costs just $100 and covers the full costs of peer review and publication.
LiveCoMS is managed by Michael R. Shirts, Daniel M. Zuckerman, and David L. Mobley, with category lead editors Jean-Philip Piquemal, Michael R. Shirts, Daniel M. Zuckerman, David L. Mobley and Rommie E. Amaro.
We have a world-class [editorial board](http://www.livecomsjournal.org/editorial-board) and look forward to receiving your submissions, and to interacting with you as we advance the field of molecular simulations.
